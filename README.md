# Payload-Loader Installer
A (hopefully) userfriendly and safe installer to inject a ["payload.elf-loader"](https://github.com/wiiu-env/PayloadFromRPX) into the Health and Safety application via [FailST](https://maschell.github.io/homebrew/2020/12/02/failst.html).

To be able to do a coldboot setup you need launch this installer via the Health & Safety injection itself.

**Use the installer to uninstall the Payload-Loader, even a factory won't remove it**

**There is always the risk of bricking the console, only proceed with installing if you understand this risk**

# Features
- Inject [PayloadFromRPX](https://github.com/wiiu-env/PayloadFromRPX) into the Health & Safety application.
- Change the boot-title of the console to Health & Safety to coldboot into PayloadFromRPX.
- Various (hash)-checks to make sure the installation will be successful.
- Restore the original Health & Safety Application.

## Usage

Load the Installer with the [PayloadLoaderInstallerEnvironment](https://github.com/wiiu-env/PayloadLoaderInstallerEnvironment) or [homebrew_on_menu_plugin](https://github.com/wiiu-env/homebrew_on_menu_plugin).

- Coldbooting into the Payload-Loader can only be activated if you launch the installer from an environment that has been loaded by the Payload-Loader. This ensures the Payload-Loader is actually working properly before coldbooting into it. 
- **Launching the Payload-Loader Installer from the browser won't let change the boot title to Payload-Loader.**
- The PayloadFromRPX can only be updated when coldbooting into the Wii U Menu.
- Coldbooting can only be activated when the installer recognizes the PayloadFromRPX.
- The installer is only designed to work with a unmodifed system. **If your have modified the Health & Safety Application or system.xml in the past the installer may fail** 

## Building using the Dockerfile

It's possible to use a docker image for building. This way you don't need anything installed on your host system.

```
# Build docker image (only needed once)
docker build . -t payloadloaderinstaller-builder

# make 
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/project payloadloaderinstaller-builder make

# make clean
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/project payloadloaderinstaller-builder make clean
```
